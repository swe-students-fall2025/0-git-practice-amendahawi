## Something I found a little interesting

I recently read a report by Microsoft on **frontier firms** and the evolving relationship between humans and AI in the workplace, describing a transformation from humans with AI assistants, to humans working alongside AI agents, and finally to organizations that are human-led but agent-operated.

The idea of being able to 'buy' intelligence "on tap" was particularly fascinating to me, almost as if it is a commodity. Iâ€™ve also noticed the rise of AI agents as copilots, which is already reshaping how we work and impacts my own personal workflow. I think the transition to having agent colleagues will be really interesting and will continue to be transformative to how humans work.
