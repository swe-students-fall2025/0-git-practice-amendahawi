# A little about me

My name is **Abdul** and I'm a third-year computer science student at NYU. I've been loving both studying **computer science** and living in the city. It has been a big change coming from living a suburban life on the West Coast. I'm really into **neural networks**, **game development**, and using software to create **creative experiences**.

I'm looking forward to improving my overall software engineering skills in this class, especially learning **best practices**. I'm also excited to meet new people and collaborate on projects with everyone.

# Something I found a little interesting

I recently found an interesting report by Microsoft on "frontier firms" and the transformation from humans with AI assistants, to humans working alongside AI agents, to organizations being human-led and agent-operated.

Report can be read [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born?msockid=30a40596d15868de32da10d6d0716900).
